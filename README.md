# SDA-software-testing-project

This repository contains the project I worked on while undergoing software testing training at SDA. 
The pdf document contains the detailed report on the manual and little automation testing
of spofify website using different tools and techniques learnt in the course of the training.
This is the final project done to test the studentâ€™s knowledge on what they have learnt in
the last 4 months of software testing training. In this report, google sheet and testrail tool
were used to develop and execute the test cases, though the test execution report was
made using google sheet. For the automation part, selenium IDE and selenium webdriver
were used. Issues/bugs found were reported using Jira test management tool. For every
bugs, there is a need to suggest improvements which were done in this report. Finally,
testing techniques used were also listed and summary of the whole process were
presented.
